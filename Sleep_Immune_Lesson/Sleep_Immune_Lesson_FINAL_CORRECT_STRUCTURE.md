# Sleep = Immune Recharge
## A ModelIt! Lesson for 5th Grade

**Grade Level:** 5th Grade (Ages 10-11)
**Platform:** Cell Collective (ModelIt!)
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Standards:** NGSS 5-LS1-1, 5-PS3-1, 5-LS2.A

## Overview

Have you ever noticed that when you stay up late, you catch colds more easily? That's because **sleep is when your body recharges its immune system!**

In this lesson, you'll build a digital model showing how sleep affects your immune system. You'll create components like Sleep, Immune Strength, White Blood Cells, and Germs, then connect them together. Finally, you'll run simulations to see exactly what happens when you get different amounts of sleep—from a full 8-hour night to no sleep at all!

**Big Question:** Why is sleep so important for staying healthy?

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify the 5 components that make up your immune system model
- Explain how sleep affects immune strength through cause-and-effect relationships
- Create connections (arrows) showing how the immune system works
- Run simulations and observe what happens with different sleep levels
- Compare results and draw conclusions about the importance of sleep

## Activity 1: Building Your Body's Defense Team

### Video Script (≈2 minutes)

**PART 1: WELCOME (0:00-0:15)**
- Show workspace with background image
- Narrator explains 5 zones
- Student job: Add 5 components, one in each zone

**PART 2: CREATING FIRST COMPONENT (0:15-0:45)**
- Find + button for adding components
- Create "Sleep" component
- Gray circle means External Component

**PART 3: POSITIONING & MORE COMPONENTS (0:45-1:45)**
- Drag Sleep to top zone
- Create Immune Strength → shield zone
- Create White Blood Cells → middle zone
- Create Germs → germs zone
- Create Your Energy → bottom zone

**PART 4: CELEBRATION (1:45-2:00)**
- All 5 components positioned
- Next: Connect with arrows
- Great job!

### Student Instructions
1. Click + button for "Add Component"
2. Type "Sleep", click Create
3. Drag to top zone
4. Repeat for other 4 components
5. Save model

### Checklist
- ☐ Created all 5 components
- ☐ All positioned correctly
- ☐ All gray (not orange)
- ☐ Model saved

## Activity 2: Connecting the Defense Chain

### Video Script (≈2 minutes)

**PART 1: WHAT ARE CONNECTIONS? (0:00-0:20)**
- Arrow = "affects" or "influences"
- Sleep → Immune Strength means more sleep = stronger immunity

**PART 2: FIRST CONNECTION (0:20-0:45)**
- Find arrow/connection tool
- Click Sleep, then Immune Strength
- Arrow shows cause-effect

**PART 3: DEFENSE CHAIN (0:45-1:45)**
- Create 5 connections total
- Sleep → Immune Strength
- Immune Strength → White Blood Cells
- White Blood Cells → Germs
- Germs → Your Energy
- Sleep → Your Energy

**PART 4: WHAT THIS MEANS (1:45-2:00)**
- Model tells story of how sleep protects
- Sleep directly + indirect effects

### Student Instructions
1. Find connection/arrow tool
2. Click Sleep → Immune Strength
3. Create remaining 4 connections
4. Verify all arrows visible
5. Save model

### Checklist
- ☐ All 5 arrows created
- ☐ All arrows connected
- ☐ Model saved

## Activity 3: Running Your First Simulation

### Video Script (≈1.5 minutes)

- Find "Simulation" mode
- Explain Sleep slider (0-100%)
- Show eye icons for observation
- Click Play to run
- Watch graph with colored lines

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Enter Simulation Mode**
- Click "Simulation" button
- See Sleep slider

**Step 2: Select What to Observe**
- Click eye icons for:
  - Immune Strength
  - White Blood Cells
  - Germs

**Step 3: Set Sleep to 100%**
- Drag slider to right
- Full 8-hour sleep

**Step 4: Run Simulation**
- Click Play
- Watch 30-40 seconds
- Observe which lines go UP/DOWN
- Click Stop

### Checklist
- ☐ Entered Simulation Mode
- ☐ Selected components to observe
- ☐ Set Sleep to 100%
- ☐ Ran simulation
- ☐ Observed results

## Activity 4: Testing Different Sleep Levels

### Video Script (≈2 minutes)

- Test 3 scenarios: 100%, 50%, 0%

**TEST 1: Full Sleep (100%)**
- Immune Strength UP, White Blood Cells UP, Germs DOWN
- HEALTHY scenario

**TEST 2: Limited Sleep (50%)**
- Changes happen slower
- Immune response weakened
- COMPROMISED scenario

**TEST 3: No Sleep (0%)**
- No improvement
- Germs stay high
- SICK scenario

**PATTERN:** More sleep = Stronger immunity = Healthier you!

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Test #1 (100%)**
- Set Sleep slider to 100%
- Click Play, watch 30-40 seconds
- Record observations

**Step 2: Reset**
- Click Stop

**Step 3: Test #2 (50%)**
- Set Sleep to 50%
- Click Play, watch 30-40 seconds
- Record: Different from Test 1?

**Step 4: Reset**
- Click Stop

**Step 5: Test #3 (0%)**
- Set Sleep to 0%
- Click Play, watch 30-40 seconds
- Record observations

**Step 6: Compare**
- Think about differences
- Healthiest scenario?
- Most likely to get sick?

### Checklist
- ☐ Ran all 3 tests
- ☐ Recorded observations
- ☐ Compared results
- ☐ Understand pattern

## Activity 5: Knowledge Check

### Questions

**Q1:** What is Sleep in this model?
- **A:** An external component you control

**Q2:** What do White Blood Cells do?
- **A:** Fight off germs and invaders

**Q3:** When you have MORE sleep, what happens to Germs?
- **A:** Germs decrease

**Q4:** What are CYTOKINES?
- **A:** Special proteins made during sleep

**Q5:** Which would make you most likely to get sick?
- **A:** Getting 0 hours of sleep

**Q6:** What does Sleep → Immune Strength mean?
- **A:** Sleep affects and strengthens the immune system

### Reflection

**Why is sleep important for your immune system?**

Your answer should include:
- Sleep makes immune system stronger
- More sleep = more white blood cells
- More white blood cells = fewer germs
- Fewer germs = healthier + more energy
- Sleep directly gives energy
