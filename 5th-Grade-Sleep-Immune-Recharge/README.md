## Overview

Have you ever noticed that when you're really tired, you catch colds more easily? That's because sleep is when your body recharges its immune system—your personal army of germ fighters!

In this lesson, you will become a health scientist who builds and tests a digital model of how sleep affects your body's defense system. Step by step, you will create the main parts—Sleep, Immune Strength, White Blood Cells, Germs, and Your Energy—and place them in the correct order. You'll connect them with arrows to show how sleep powers your body's defenses, then run simulations to see what happens when you get enough sleep versus when you don't.

By the end, you'll understand why those 8-10 hours of sleep each night aren't just about feeling good—they're about staying healthy and keeping germs away!

## 🔬 Research Section

### Activity 1: Building Your Body's Defense Team

**⏱️ Time:** 8-10 minutes

#### 📖 Narrative (Teacher reads aloud or students read)

Every night when you sleep, something amazing happens inside your body. Your immune system—the team of defenders that fights off germs—gets stronger and prepares for the next day. Think of sleep like charging your phone: without enough charge, your phone can't work properly. Without enough sleep, your immune system can't protect you properly!

Today, you're going to build a digital model that shows exactly how this works. You'll create five important parts: Sleep (the energy source), Immune Strength (your defense power), White Blood Cells (your germ fighters), Germs (the invaders), and Your Energy (how you feel).

Let's start by building these parts as **components** in your model.

---

#### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Start Fresh**
- Go to the **Graph panel** in ModelIt!
- Click **New Layout** to start with a clean workspace
- You should see an empty graph area

**Step 2: Add Your First Component - Sleep**
- Look at the **Internal Components** panel (usually on the right side)
- Click the **+ (plus)** button
- A small text box will appear
- Type: **Sleep**
- Press **Enter**
- You'll see a gray circle (node) appear in the Graph panel with the label "Sleep"

**Step 3: Add the Remaining Components**
Repeat Step 2 four more times to create these components:
- **Immune Strength**
- **White Blood Cells**
- **Germs**
- **Your Energy**

**Step 4: Arrange Your Model**
Drag the circles (nodes) to arrange them vertically in this order from top to bottom:

```
        ⬇️
     [Sleep]
        ⬇️
  [Immune Strength]
        ⬇️
  [White Blood Cells]
        ⬇️
     [Germs]
        ⬇️
   [Your Energy]
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** Space them out evenly so you have room for arrows later!

---

#### ✅ Check Your Work

Before moving on, make sure:
- [ ] You have exactly 5 components (gray circles)
- [ ] Each component has the correct label
- [ ] They are arranged vertically like a ladder
- [ ] All components are gray (we'll change one later!)

---

#### 🤔 Think About It (Reflection Questions)

**Turn & Talk with a partner:**
1. Why do you think we put Sleep at the top of our model?
2. What do you predict will happen if Sleep is removed from the model?
3. In your own words, what does "Immune Strength" mean?

**Teacher Note:** Give students 2-3 minutes to discuss. Ask 2-3 pairs to share with the class.

---

#### 🌟 Cool Science Fact!

Did you know that during sleep, your body produces special proteins called **cytokines** (sy-toh-kynes)? These proteins help your immune system communicate and fight infections. When you don't sleep enough, your body makes fewer cytokines—like having fewer soldiers in your defense army!

Some types of cytokines even help you sleep better when you're sick. That's why you feel extra sleepy when you have a cold—your body is trying to make you rest so it can heal!

---

### Activity 2: Connecting the Defense Chain

**⏱️ Time:** 8-10 minutes

#### 📖 Narrative

Now that you've built the parts of your immune defense system, it's time to show how they work together. In science, we use **arrows** to show cause-and-effect relationships. An arrow from one component to another means: "This affects that."

For example, if we draw an arrow from Sleep to Immune Strength, it means "Sleep affects (or causes changes in) Immune Strength."

You're going to create a **defense chain** that shows how sleep powers your body's ability to fight germs and stay energized!

---

#### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Connect Sleep to Immune Strength**
- In the Graph panel, **click once** on the **Sleep** circle
- **Hold down your mouse button** and drag toward **Immune Strength**
- When Immune Strength turns **green** (or highlights), release your mouse button
- A **black arrow** should appear pointing from Sleep to Immune Strength
- **What this means:** "When you sleep, your immune strength increases!"

**Step 2: Connect Immune Strength to White Blood Cells**
- Click on **Immune Strength**
- Drag to **White Blood Cells**
- Release when it highlights
- **What this means:** "When your immune strength is high, your body produces more white blood cells to fight germs!"

**Step 3: Connect White Blood Cells to Germs**
- Click on **White Blood Cells**
- Drag to **Germs**
- Release when it highlights
- **What this means:** "White blood cells attack and control germs!"

**Step 4: Connect Germs to Your Energy**
- Click on **Germs**
- Drag to **Your Energy**
- Release when it highlights
- **What this means:** "When germs are in your body, they can make you feel tired and drain your energy!"

**Step 5: Connect Immune Strength to Your Energy**
- Click on **Immune Strength**
- Drag to **Your Energy**
- Release when it highlights
- **What this means:** "When your immune system is strong, you have more energy and feel better!"

**Step 6: Adjust for Clarity**
- If any arrows overlap or are hard to see, you can **drag the circles** to new positions
- The arrows will automatically adjust
- Arrange your model so all arrows are easy to follow

---

#### ✅ Check Your Work

Before moving on, verify:
- [ ] You have exactly 5 arrows
- [ ] All arrows point in the correct direction (like a chain flowing down)
- [ ] No arrows are pointing backward
- [ ] You can clearly see the path: Sleep → Immune Strength → White Blood Cells → Germs → Your Energy
- [ ] There's also an arrow: Immune Strength → Your Energy

**Your model should look like this:**

```
     [Sleep]
        ↓
  [Immune Strength] ━━━━┓
        ↓                ↓
  [White Blood Cells]    ↓
        ↓                ↓
     [Germs]             ↓
        ↓                ↓
   [Your Energy] ←━━━━━━┛
```

---

#### 🤔 Think About It (Reflection Questions)

**Quick Write (2 minutes):**
Write your answer in your science notebook:

1. "Why do the arrows always point forward in our model? Could energy flow backward?"
2. "What happens in the 'real world' when white blood cells fight germs in your body?"

**Class Discussion:**
- Call on 3-4 students to share their answers
- Emphasize the one-way flow of cause and effect

---

#### 🌟 Cool Science Fact!

Your body has about **25 billion** white blood cells at any given time! That's more than 3 times the number of people on Earth, all working inside YOU to keep you healthy.

When you're fighting an infection, your body can make these cells multiply faster—sometimes doubling the count in just a few hours. It's like calling in reinforcements when there's an emergency!

But here's the catch: your body makes most of these new cells **while you sleep**. Less sleep = fewer reinforcements!

---

### Activity 3: Testing the Model - What Happens With NO Sleep?

**⏱️ Time:** 10-12 minutes

#### 📖 Narrative

You've built your model. You've connected the parts. Now comes the exciting part—**running the simulation!**

A simulation is like a science experiment inside the computer. We're going to test a very important question:

**"What happens to your immune system when you don't get enough sleep?"**

To answer this, we'll set Sleep to 0% (meaning no sleep at all—like pulling an all-nighter) and watch what happens to all the other parts of the system.

Scientists call this a **controlled experiment** because we're changing just ONE thing (sleep) and observing what happens to everything else.

---

#### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Switch to Simulation Mode**
- At the top of your screen, click **Workspace → Model → Simulation**
- You'll see a new view with graphs and controls
- This is where you'll run your experiments!

**Step 2: Make Sleep an External Component**
External components are things you can control (like turning a dial up or down).

- Go back to **Workspace → Model** (the graph view)
- Find the **Sleep** circle
- Hold down the **Shift** key on your keyboard
- While holding Shift, **click** on the Sleep circle
- It should turn **orange** (or a different color than the gray circles)
- This means Sleep is now "external"—you control it!

**Step 3: Choose What to Observe**
- Go back to **Workspace → Model → Simulation**
- Look for the **Internal Components** panel (usually on the right)
- You'll see your four gray components listed:
  - Immune Strength
  - White Blood Cells
  - Germs
  - Your Energy
- Find the **eye icon (👁️)** or checkbox next to each one
- **Click to activate** the eye icon for ALL FOUR components
- This tells the computer: "I want to watch these on the graph"

**Step 4: Set Sleep to 0% (No Sleep)**
- Look for the **External Components** panel (usually top-left)
- You should see **Sleep** listed
- Find the **Activity slider** next to Sleep
- **Drag the slider all the way to the left** to 0%
- This means: "No sleep! Zero hours!"

**Step 5: Run the Simulation**
- In the **Simulation Control** panel, find the **Play button (▶)**
- Click **Play**
- Watch the graph!
- You'll see colored lines appear showing how each component changes over time

**Step 6: Observe the Results**
Watch what happens on the graph. You should see:
- **Immune Strength:** Stays flat or very low (because there's no sleep to boost it)
- **White Blood Cells:** Stays low (because immune strength isn't activating them)
- **Germs:** May stay high or increase (because white blood cells aren't fighting them)
- **Your Energy:** Stays low or decreases (because germs are present and immune system is weak)

---

#### ✅ Check Your Work

Make sure:
- [ ] Sleep is orange (external)
- [ ] Sleep slider is set to 0%
- [ ] All 4 internal components have eye icons activated (👁️)
- [ ] You pressed Play and saw the graph run
- [ ] You can see the colored lines on the graph

---

#### 📊 Record Your Data

In your science notebook, create this table and fill it in based on what you observed:

| Component | What Happened? (High, Medium, or Low) | Why do you think this happened? |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Immune Strength | | |
| White Blood Cells | | |
| Germs | | |
| Your Energy | | |

---

#### 🤔 Think About It (Reflection Questions)

**Partner Discussion (3 minutes):**

1. Which component stayed the flattest on the graph? Why?
2. What does a flat line mean in real life for your body?
3. Have you ever stayed up really late and then gotten sick? How does this model help explain why that might happen?

**Teacher Prompts:**
- "What pattern do you notice in the graph?"
- "If Immune Strength is low, what happens to the rest of the system?"
- "Can you trace the cause-and-effect chain from Sleep to Your Energy?"

---

#### 🌟 Cool Science Fact!

Scientists did a real experiment where they kept people awake for 24 hours straight, then exposed them to cold viruses. The people who stayed awake were **THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY** to get sick compared to people who slept normally!

Even missing just 1-2 hours of sleep per night over a week can weaken your immune system. It's like slowly draining a battery—eventually, there's not enough power left to fight germs.

Your model just showed exactly what those scientists discovered in their lab!

---

### Activity 4: Testing the Model - What Changes With Enough Sleep?

**⏱️ Time:** 10-12 minutes

#### 📖 Narrative

You just saw what happens when Sleep is at 0%—not good for your immune system!

Now let's test the opposite scenario:

**"What happens to your immune system when you get PLENTY of sleep?"**

Doctors recommend that 5th graders get **9-11 hours** of sleep each night. For our model, we'll set Sleep to 100%, which represents getting all the sleep your body needs.

This is how scientists work: they compare different conditions to see what makes a difference. In science, we call this a **comparative experiment**.

---

#### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Reset the Simulation (if needed)**
- In the Simulation workspace, find the **Stop button (⏹)** in Simulation Control
- Click Stop to reset
- This clears the old graph so you can see the new results clearly

**Step 2: Adjust Sleep to 100% (Full Sleep)**
- Go to the **External Components** panel
- Find **Sleep**
- **Drag the Activity slider all the way to the RIGHT** to 100%
- This means: "Full sleep! 9-11 hours of great rest!"

**Step 3: Confirm Your Observation Settings**
Double-check that the eye icons (👁️) are still active for:
- [ ] Immune Strength
- [ ] White Blood Cells
- [ ] Germs
- [ ] Your Energy

**Step 4: Run the NEW Simulation**
- Click the **Play button (▶)** again
- Watch carefully as the graph develops
- Compare what you see to Activity 3!

**Step 5: Observe the NEW Results**
This time you should see:
- **Immune Strength:** Rises steadily (because sleep is providing the boost it needs!)
- **White Blood Cells:** Increases over time (because immune strength is activating production!)
- **Germs:** Decreases or stays controlled (because white blood cells are fighting them!)
- **Your Energy:** Rises and stays high (because your immune system is protecting you and you're well-rested!)

---

#### ✅ Check Your Work

Verify:
- [ ] Sleep slider is at 100%
- [ ] All 4 eye icons (👁️) are active
- [ ] You pressed Play
- [ ] Graph shows RISING lines (not flat like Activity 3)
- [ ] You can see the difference between 0% sleep and 100% sleep

---

#### 📊 Record Your Data

Add to your science notebook table:

| Component | 0% Sleep (Activity 3) | 100% Sleep (Activity 4) | What's the Difference? |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Immune Strength | | | |
| White Blood Cells | | | |
| Germs | | | |
| Your Energy | | | |

---

#### 🤔 Think About It (Reflection Questions)

**Class Discussion (5 minutes):**

1. **Compare and Contrast:** What was different between the two simulations? What stayed the same?

2. **Cause and Effect Chain:** Starting with Sleep, trace the chain of effects all the way to Your Energy. Use the words "because" and "so" to connect your explanation.
   - Example: "When Sleep is at 100%, Immune Strength goes up BECAUSE..."

3. **Real-World Connection:** Based on this model, what advice would you give to a friend who keeps getting sick? Use evidence from your simulation.

4. **Critical Thinking:** Our model shows what happens with 0% sleep and 100% sleep. What do you predict would happen with 50% sleep (only 4-5 hours)? Why?

**Teacher Note:** For question 4, you can have students test 50% as an extension activity!

---

#### 🧪 Extension Challenge (Optional)

**For Early Finishers or Advanced Students:**

Test different sleep percentages and record the results:

- 25% sleep (2-3 hours)
- 50% sleep (4-5 hours)
- 75% sleep (7-8 hours)
- 100% sleep (9-11 hours)

Create a **line graph** showing how Immune Strength changes with different amounts of sleep. What pattern do you notice?

---

#### 🌟 Cool Science Fact!

Here's something amazing: when you DO get enough sleep, your body doesn't just fight germs better—it also **remembers** germs better!

Your immune system creates "memory cells" while you sleep. These cells remember germs you've fought before, so if the same germ comes back, your body can fight it off even faster—sometimes before you even feel sick!

This is why vaccines work better when you sleep well after getting them. Sleep helps your body "save" the information about the vaccine, like saving a file on a computer.

So sleep isn't just about fighting germs NOW—it's about being ready for germs in the FUTURE too!

- Look for: Basic understanding that sleep is "good for you" or "helps you rest"

**During Activity 1:**
- Look for: Ability to follow multi-step procedures, correctly create and label components
- Support needed if: Student struggles with interface, components are mislabeled

**During Activity 2:**
- Ask: "What does this arrow mean?" (pointing to any arrow)
- Look for: Understanding of cause-and-effect relationships
- Support needed if: Student creates arrows in wrong directions or random connections

**During Activities 3-4:**
- Ask: "What do you notice about this graph?"
- Look for: Ability to interpret visual data, compare two conditions
- Support needed if: Student can't identify differences between 0% and 100% results

**End of Lesson (Summative):**

---

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue 1: "My arrows won't appear!"**
- **Cause:** Student is not clicking and dragging properly
- **Solution:** Demonstrate again slowly. Remind: Click, HOLD, drag, release when green.

**Issue 2: "I can't find the External Components panel"**
- **Cause:** Student is in wrong view or panel is collapsed
- **Solution:** Ensure student is in Simulation view. Check if panel can be expanded.

**Issue 3: "My graph shows nothing"**
- **Cause:** Eye icons not activated, or simulation not running
- **Solution:** Check that 👁️ icons are clicked for all components. Press Play button.

**Issue 4: "All my lines look the same"**
- **Cause:** Model connections may be incorrect, or Sleep not set as external
- **Solution:** Review model in graph view. Confirm Sleep is orange. Re-check arrow directions.

**Issue 5: "I accidentally deleted a component!"**
- **Cause:** Student clicked delete instead of another action
- **Solution:** Add component back using + button. Reconnect arrows. Remind about careful clicking.

1. B - Because it is the source that activates and strengthens the immune system
2. B - They stay low because Immune Strength isn't activating them
3. C - Immune Strength
4. B - Cause-and-effect relationships between components
5. C - Getting enough sleep helps your immune system fight germs

---

### Reflection Questions Answer Guide

**Activity 1 - Think About It:**

1. "Why do you think we put Sleep at the top of our model?"
   - **Ideal answer:** Sleep is the starting point/source that affects everything else, like how the Sun is the source of energy in a food web.

2. "What do you predict will happen if Sleep is removed from the model?"
   - **Ideal answer:** The immune system won't work well, white blood cells won't increase, and germs won't be controlled.

3. "In your own words, what does 'Immune Strength' mean?"
   - **Ideal answer:** How strong/powerful your body's defense system is at fighting germs and keeping you healthy.

---

**Activity 2 - Think About It:**

1. "Why do the arrows always point forward in our model?"
   - **Ideal answer:** Because they show cause and effect—one thing leads to the next. Energy/effects flow in one direction.

2. "Could energy ever flow backward?"
   - **Ideal answer:** No, because in real life, causes come before effects. Sleep causes immunity to strengthen, not the other way around.

3. "What happens in the 'real world' when white blood cells fight germs?"
   - **Ideal answer:** They attack germs, surround them, and destroy them to keep you from getting sick.

---

**Activity 3 - Think About It:**

1. "Which component stayed the flattest on the graph? Why?"
   - **Ideal answer:** Immune Strength and White Blood Cells stayed flat because Sleep was at 0%, so there was no energy source to activate them.

2. "What does a flat line mean in real life for your body?"
   - **Ideal answer:** It means that part of your system isn't working/active. For immunity, it means your body can't defend itself well.

3. "Have you ever stayed up really late and then gotten sick?"
   - **Ideal answer:** (Personal response, but should connect to model showing low immunity when sleep is lacking)

---

**Activity 4 - Think About It:**

1. "Compare and Contrast: What was different between the two simulations?"
   - **Ideal answer:** With 0% sleep, everything stayed low/flat. With 100% sleep, immunity and white blood cells went up, germs went down, energy went up.

2. "Cause and Effect Chain: Starting with Sleep, trace the effects to Your Energy."
   - **Ideal answer:** Sleep increases Immune Strength BECAUSE it provides rest/recovery. Immune Strength activates White Blood Cells BECAUSE a strong system produces more defenders. White Blood Cells control Germs BECAUSE they fight and destroy them. With fewer Germs, Your Energy stays high BECAUSE your body isn't fighting infection. Also, high Immune Strength directly gives more energy.

3. "Based on this model, what advice would you give to a sick friend?"
   - **Ideal answer:** Get lots of sleep! The model shows that sleep boosts your immune system, which helps your body fight germs and gives you more energy to recover.

4. "What do you predict would happen with 50% sleep?"
   - **Ideal answer:** Results would be in between—not as bad as 0% sleep, but not as good as 100% sleep. Immunity would be medium strength, which might not be enough to fully control germs.
